# TensorFlow

Both projects were creating following the tutorials on the TensorFlow Webpage for Keras API.

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification

These projects taught me the power of using the Keras API as I am able to pre-process data efficiently and creating a model that can 
recognize images and text.
